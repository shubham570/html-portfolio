<p>At Twilio, I have worked closely with the team of professionals to design, and implement new features, and improve the overall efficiency of the system. During my time there, I was focused on enriching consumer experience and worked on various features to ensure smooth communication sent from Twilio platform that should be safe and legal. Worked in Regulatory Compliance team there in which certain policies created for communication(messaging, email, etc) that should strike a balance between company objectives and customer needs. Ranging from metrics, and alarms to dashboards and enhancing the response time of the system, I have worked and grown into the software engineer role acquiring the right amount of skill set and getting inspired to think and implement more features to improve the overall experience for consumers. </p>

<p>  At Oracle, I worked on a developmental project which was based on developing a microservice from scratch using REST Api's, the objective of this project was to shift their OIRI that was accessible by linux commands into a microservice for Data Ingestion (DING) and this was done by creating REST Api's using swagger software and used oracle's helidon framework to get all the api's into functioning.</p>
